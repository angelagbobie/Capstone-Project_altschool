# Capstone-Project_altschool
Project Overview

This project involves extracting data from a PostgreSQL database, loading it into Google BigQuery, and performing data analysis and visualization.

Project Structure

The project is structured into the following directories:

- data/: contains the raw data files
- etl/: contains the ETL code (Python scripts)
- analysis/: contains the data analysis and visualization code (Python scripts)
- docs/: contains documentation for the project, including this README file

Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- PostgreSQL database
- Google BigQuery account
- psycopg2 library for connecting to PostgreSQL database
- google-cloud-bigquery library for connecting to Google BigQuery
- pandas library for data manipulation and analysis
- matplotlib library for data visualization

ETL Pipeline

The ETL pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. Extract data from PostgreSQL database using psycopg2 library
2. Load data into Google BigQuery using google-cloud-bigquery library
3. Transform data into suitable format for analysis using pandas library

Data Analysis and Visualization

The data analysis and visualization code consists of the following steps:

1. Load data from Google BigQuery into pandas dataframe
2. Perform data analysis using pandas library
3. Create visualizations using matplotlib library

Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using git clone
2. Install required libraries using pip install
3. Configure PostgreSQL database connection using psycopg2 library
4. Configure Google BigQuery connection using google-cloud-bigquery library
5. Run ETL pipeline using python (link unavailable)
6. Run data analysis and visualization code using python (link unavailable)

Troubleshooting

- Check database connections and credentials
- Check library versions and install latest versions if necessary
- Check data formats and adjust code accordingly
